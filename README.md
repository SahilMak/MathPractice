# MathPractice
Android app that allows users to practice mental math using the four basic functions.

This is a very basic app that will allow me to familiarize myself with Android Studio
as well as Android app development in general. I'm not sure if it will work with the
Eclipse plugin, but feel free to try it. Also, if you know how to eliminate the need
for 4 separate activities (one for each math function) in place of 1 activity that can
be edited appropriately based on the user's selection on the main menu, please feel
free to let me know.
